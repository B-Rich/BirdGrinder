# BirdGrinder - an evented ruby twitter library #

BirdGrinder is my attempt at an evented twitter library / "framework"
for ruby. Based on Perennial and very much influenced by [Marvin](http://github.com/Sutto/marvin)'s design, even to the
level of sharing a lot of code, BirdGrinder is designed to make
it simple and easy to create twitter bots / clients that react to
events such as processing searches / streams, automatically processing
mentions and direct messages.

One example of this usage is for a twitter game - BirdGrinder was
originally written for use in Nick Plante's upcoming werewolf game
and has been used to write a couple of other tools (e.g. a real
time updating twitter stream for a conference).

## Contributing ##

I welcome any and all contributions, but please keep a few things in mind:

- I have the right to decide what gets pulled in.
- If you maintain your own version, please bump it in separate commits to actual functionality.
- I'm an idiot because I haven't written tests yet. Sorry!
